"""The training flow.

Week 4 gave this project a DAG runner already, so the first question the week
has to answer is why there is now a second one:

    `dvc repro` answers **is this stale?**  Its graph is about CONTENT.
    Prefect answers **did it run, when, how many times, and what then?**
    Its graph is about EXECUTION.

They are not competitors and this module does not stage them as one. The flow
calls `dvc repro` as a single task for the content-hashed core, and owns the
things DVC has no opinion about: the network edges, the retries, the runtime
parameters, the schedule, and the record that any of it happened.

    DVC tells you what is out of date. Prefect tells you what happened.

    Parameters are FLOW parameters, which is what lets you re-run this from the
    UI with a different `C` and no code change. They are funnelled through
    `write_params` into `params.yaml` before the pipeline runs -- see that
    task's docstring for why anything else silently produces a stale model.

    `push` and `register_model_version` default to False because they need the
    stack. The flow is useful without them, which is what makes it testable.

    NOTE WHAT IS ABSENT FROM THIS SIGNATURE: a `settings` parameter.
    Prefect builds a pydantic model from a flow's signature so that runs can be
    scheduled, re-run from the UI and triggered by API — which means **every
    flow parameter has to be serialisable**. Passing a dataclass here looks
    harmless and works when you call the function directly; it then fails only
    when a SCHEDULED run tries to validate its parameters:

        Validation of flow parameters failed with error: PydanticUserError:
        `Scheduled_FlowModel` is not fully defined; you should define
        `Settings`, then call `Scheduled_FlowModel.model_rebuild()`

    Measured, on a real scheduled run, while building this lab. A flow
    signature is a public API. Keep it to strings, numbers and booleans.
